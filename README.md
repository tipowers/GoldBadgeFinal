# Gold Badge Final
## What a time to be alive! 
## I started a new position as a VBA developer the same week these challenges were released. I went from having plenty of time to focus on academy work to learning two new languages at once.
## I was able to finish the project with a couple minor bugs in the second and third of the three projects. Overall, I am pleased with the work I accomplished in the amount of time I ended up not having!
## I understand this README is lacking. Please accept my apologies. As soon as possible, I will spruce this up to look much better and also include specific details on what to expect navigating through my Gold Badge Cahllenge submissions.
